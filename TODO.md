## Things that still need to be added
- Add the remaining OpenSees classes
- Simplify callouts to opensees classes
- organize how the tcl files are written... it should probably go something like this
    - Initiate Basic Builder
    - Nodes
    - Materials
    - Sections
    - Elements
    - Shells
    - Restraints/Constraints
    - Output Commands
    - Eigen
    - Loading
    - Gravity Analysis
    - Pushover loading
    - Pushover Solution Algorithm
        - Number
        - System
        - Analysis
        - Constraint
        - Type
        - Test
        - Algorithm
        - Integrator
        - Analysis
    - Ground Motions
    - Dynamic Solution Algorithm
    - Other (Anything can be put here... I sometimes like to run a pushover after a dynamic analysis to see if my structure has collapse... others might want to run another ground-motion)
- Solution Algorithms need to be inserted manually or using a helper
- Shorten callout so that it goes like this:
    - Analysis
        - Algorithm
        - Analysis
        - Analyze
        - Constraints
        - Eigen
        - Integrator
        - Numberer
        - System
        - Test
    - Node
    - Element
    - Material
        - UniaxialMaterial
        - ND Material
    - Section
    - BasicBuilder
    - Constraint
    - Pattern
    - TimeSeries
    - TCL
    - Database
    - Output
    - Executible
    - Misc
